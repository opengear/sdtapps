==========================================
1.    Introduction
==========================================
This document attempts to provide a brief introduction using the
Opengear SDT utility suite source-code.

==========================================
2.    Dependencies
==========================================
To build the Opengear SDT utility it is recommended you have already
installed the following.

- A Java Development Kit 1.4 or newer.
  (The Sun JDK1.5 is recommended, but anything newer should work)

- The Apache Ant build tool.
  (The latest Ant can be sourced from http://ant.apache.org/.)

=========================================
3.    Compiling
=========================================
The quickest way to get started is to change into the SDTConnector 
sub-directory and compile the Jar File as follows.

# cd SDTConnector
# ant jar

This will produce a dist/ directory which includes the file: 
sdtcon.jar

=========================================
4.    Running
=========================================

The Jar file can be invoked from the command line with:

# java -jar dist/sdtcon.jar
